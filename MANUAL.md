### Inputs

- Rotary encoder with push button
- Reset button

### Outputs

- Status LED
- Output light (LED in prototype)

### Usage

#### Controllng the output light

Adjust brightness of the output light with the rotary encoder. Turn clockwise to increase brightness, turn anticlockwise to decrease brightness.

Turn output light on/off without changing the brightness, with the rotary encoder push button.

Decreasing brightness to zero will turn the output light off but set the brightness to max (so that if you turn it on with the push button it will come on fully, instead of with brightness zero).

Increasing the brightness from off will turn the output light on and increment from the lowest brightness.
